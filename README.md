# Setting up your local coding environment

n this software engineering training, all projects are designed to be done in the Ubuntu 20.04 Linux environment.

There are several ways of acquiring an Ubuntu 20.04 Linux environment in case your host operating system is not one:

Dual booting: Install Linux alongside Windows on your computer, allowing you to choose which operating system to use at startup.
Via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): provides a compatibility layer that lets you run Linux binary executables natively on Windows. Recommended.
Via Virtual Machine (VM): allows you to run multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical machine simultaneously.
Via Linux Docker containers: Recommended.
Whichever method you choose to obtain a Linux working environment for yourself is okay, We recommend using docker for its flexibility, lightweight, and ease of use. You can use docker to create a lightweight Linux environment that is isolated from the rest of your computer.
